## Open Canvas Working Group

The goal of the Open Canvas Working Group (OCWG) is to **establish interoperability between different [infinite canvas tools](https://infinitecanvas.tools/).** 

The OCWG is a working group of inifinite canvas tool builders and users who are iterating on a standard to drive interoperability between a wide variety of infinite canvas tools.

**Possible outcomes:**
- Work from first principles to discover a lowest-common denominator format.
- Develop actual implementations featuring two-way synchronization between different tools.
- Develop a test bench for the standard to demonstrate capabilities of infinite canvas tools. (Similar to the [CSS Acid Tests](https://www.acidtests.org/))
- Suggest changes to the JSON Canvas specification.
