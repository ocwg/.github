## Open Canvas Working Group

The goal of the Open Canvas Working Group (OCWG) is to **establish interoperability between different [infinite canvas tools](https://infinitecanvas.tools/).** 

Obsidian took a first step by publishing [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org/), an open format that other infinite canvas tools can implement in order to interoperate with Obsidian. JSON Canvas is an excellent starting point and clearly communicates the value of interoperability between tools.

The OCWG is a working group of inifinite canvas tool builders and users who are iterating on a standard to drive interoperability between a wide variety of infinite canvas tools.

**Possible outcomes:**
- Work from first principles to discover a lowest-common denominator format.
- Develop actual implementations featuring two-way synchronization between different tools.
- Develop a test bench for the standard to demonstrate capabilities of infinite canvas tools. (Similar to the [CSS Acid Tests](https://www.acidtests.org/))
- Suggest changes to the JSON Canvas specification.

## FAQ

Q: Why not just push issues and pull requests to Obsidian's JSON Canvas? Why the separate organization, website, and name?

A: JSON Canvas is an excellent starting point, and if it serves your use case we recommend it! OCWG provides a communications forum for larger discussions around interoperability and additional resources for the development of those standards. It's a reason to get builders in the same room, working towards the same goal, talking through the challenges and collectively iterating towards solutions. We fully anticipate that our work will drive issues and pull requests against JSON Canvas!
